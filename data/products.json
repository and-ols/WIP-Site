Seriously, you put all the love in this thing. The seasoned ground beef is so flavorful, and there's just the right amount of cheese to tie it all together.This is definitely going on my must-have list whenever I'm in your neighborhood.  Seriously good stuff!"

         "icon": "/images/spin-rico-empananda.jpg",
         "testimony" : "I usually go for the savory, meaty options, but this empanada totally surprised me! The crust is still the champion â€“ seriously, how do you do it?  But the filling is like a delightful green cloud of happiness. The creamy ricotta cheese is the perfect contrast to the fresh spinach, and there's this subtle savory flavor that's just addictive.  It's filling but not heavy, and it feels healthy(ish). This is definitely a new fave for lighter lunches or a satisfying veggie side."

This isn't your average grocery store caramel; it's rich, creamy, and has a deep caramel flavor that's simply divine. The first time I opened the jar, the aroma hit me like a warm hug.
